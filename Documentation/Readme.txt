Please lock the aspect ratio to 16:9 when playing this game to ensure no important UI gets chopped off.

Important note: The counter for the collectables are meant to show the player's "journal"
This counter continues counting between every successful run, not just until you die.
The thinking here is that the user will be able to see how much work they have done in the game in their lifetime.
